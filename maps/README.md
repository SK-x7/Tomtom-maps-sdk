I used map and functionalities provided by "tomtom web sdk" and added extra functionality to the map. I added extra features to it which will be very helpful in developing my big project "Grocin-5".
Note: these changes are made to meet the requirements of my personal project "Grocin_5". 
I added some extra features :
1. Move marker to the selected search results automatically.
2. Auto-fetching and reverse geocoding of marker position/coordinates.
3. Attached custom pop-ups to marker.
